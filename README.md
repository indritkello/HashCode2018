# HashCode2018
Simple way of solving the engineering problem of HashCode Competiton (2018)

The HashCode 2018 challenge, a team-based programming competition organised by Google took place in March the 1st 2018.
Problem for this year was optimizing tasks for selfdriving vehicles. 
#Task
Given a list of pre-booked rides in a city and a fleet of self-driving vehicles, assign the rides to vehicles, so
that riders get to their destinations on time.
For every ride that finishes on time (or early), you will earn points proportional to the distance of that ride;
plus an additional bonus if the ride also started precisely on time.
